# Issue Tracker

## Status

Proposed

## Context

In order to organize work for the HEAT project, we need an issue tracker.  Having an organized work board can help facilitate breaking down and parallelizing work.

There are many project management tools.  Other Code for Boston projects, such as the [Urban League Heat Pump](https://github.com/codeforboston/urban-league-heat-pump-accelerator) project and the [Police Data Trust](https://github.com/codeforboston/police-data-trust) project use GitHub issues and projects for organizing work.

## Decision

We will use GitHub issues to organize work for the HEAT project.

## Consequences

Code for Boston contributors who have worked on other projects using GitHub issues will be familiar with the tooling for project management.

It will also be easy to link issues to code, which is also in GitHub.
