# Collaborative Development

## Status

Proposed

## Context

To effectively utilize our weekly hacking time, we will use a collaborative development tool to facilitate development among a number of live (and often remote) participants.

Other Code for Boston projects, such as the [Urban League Heat Pump](https://github.com/codeforboston/urban-league-heat-pump-accelerator) project, use GitHub Codespaces for live collaboration.

## Decision

We will use GitHub Codespaces along with ensemble programming to collaboratively develop for the HEAT project.

## Consequences

Code for Boston contributors do not need to set up their own development environments to be able to contribute.

Contributors who have used other live editing tools (such as Google Docs) may be comfortable using GitHub Codespaces.

New members will be able to participate immediately upon being added to the GitHub repository.
